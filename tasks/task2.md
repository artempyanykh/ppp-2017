# Assignment 2. Intro to modern programming tools and techniques (1 semester version). Spring '17
## Swords of Slaver's Bay

After a resoundingly successful liberation of Astapor, Meereen, and Yunkai from Slaver Alliance, Daenerys Stormborn got access to the Summer Sea and hence a path to Westeros.

To wage war against the Seven Kingdoms one needs weapons and weapons need steel.
Although, there's no doubt in the skill of Unsullied smiths, suppliers of steel are not that reliable.

Two main suppliers of steel of Westeros Inc. and Harpy & Co. For several months we've been buying steel from both
companies. However, each company offers a significant discount for switching to an exclusive contract.

Queen's adviser - Tyrion Lannister - knows about your talent in data-driven decision making and asks you to help him
choose which supplier to sign an exclusive contract with.

Tyrion has records of swords produced by Unsullied smiths and also records of swords broken during each month of war.

## Input
You have a [CSV-file](task4/production-data.csv) with the data about the number of produced and broken swords by each Unsullied smith per month.

## Objective
You need to do an [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) in order to
determine: **"Which supplier of steel Tyrion should sign an exclusive contract with?"**.

The war has been going for 7 months and this is the amount of data you have. Daenerys expects to end the war in 1.5
years, which means our planning horizon is 11 months.

## What needs to be done

1. Your analysis should be done in a **R notebook** in file `analysis.Rmd`.
2. Intermediate results of your analysis and your conclusion must be prepared in a form of a presentation created in
   `latex` using `beamer`.
3. Source code of the presentation should be in a file `presentation.tex`. You must also attach a rendered presentation
   in a `presentation.pdf` file.

## Submission
The assignment **must** be done by a group of 3.
The process is described in [README](../README.org#submission-rules).

## Dates

* The PR should be submitted before **10 Apr 2017**.
* First round of review and re-submission does not affect the grading.
* Second and further rounds of review halve the maximum grade.
